# HUM1600

Hi, welcome to my HUM 1600 Portfolio. Here, you will find my assignments from HUM 1600 taught by John Gordan at the University of Utah.
As this is my work, and it is done for an educational institution, I do not permit this work to be copied or used without written permission 
by anyone. This work is to serve as a tool for employers and others to see past projects of mine.

Thanks,
JC
